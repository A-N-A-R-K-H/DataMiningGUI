# DataMiningGUI
Graphical User Interface built using the TKinter library

Current features
  o user can import data from .xls and .csv files
  o user can choose the class label to be classified
  o user can decide to fill missing values using multivariate feature imputation
  o user can choose the algorithm to run
  
Futute work:
  o introduce unsupervised learning algorithms (currently only uses supervised ones)
  o generate graphs and save folder to path of user's choosing
  o allow user to decide to reduce the feature set to be used in the algorithm
  o compile prediction measurements into a .txt file to be saved to path of user's choosing
